My advice is to grab some books and get to it. I got a CS degree but it was theory-heavy, so my practical skills were a bit lacking. Once I grabbed a book (in my case an Android book), I thought to myself that the theory really wasn't 100% necessary to be able to do this stuff. Books can walk you through in the same way college can.
Get a firm grasp of the language you want.
Then get a grasp of the key programming paradigms -- OOP, data structures & algorithms (the main ones like Dijkstra and the search algorithms).
After that get a book or take a course on something like TeamTreehouse in the stack you like.
Then come up with a project you want to develop (should be large enough to take some time and be challenging but not too large so as to be impossible / discouraging).
Coming up with a project is easy, either build something to solve a problem you have, or just try to make your own version of an app you like -- a personal project doesn't have to be a unique breakthrough idea.
The key however, is that you must adopt programming as a hobby you do frequently if you want to be able to make a living with it. People already in the industry do it on a daily basis 40 hours a week. If you don't like doing it as a hobby, it's going to be much harder to develop the skills -- in my opinion.
