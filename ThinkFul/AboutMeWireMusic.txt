AboutMeWire MUSIC

DESCRIBE SELF

Hello! I'm a Toronto area drummer and percussionist with 15 years of experience and a <>Passion<> for a great groove. I especially love West African and African-derived musics (Cuban, Jazz, Blues etc.). I loathe being seen as "just a drummer" - I love to delve deep into the <>melody<> and <>harmony<> of a tune. I don't just drum, I <>sing<> with the drums!

WHERE FROM 

Toronto is my city and I thrive off of the diversity of cultures, people and music that can be found here. You could just as easily catch me checking out some killer live salsa at Lula Lounge or playing some jazz with friends from Humber College at one of this city's many sophisticated jazz bars. 

HOBBIES / SIDE / COOL 

When not playing, practicing, or checking out music, you might find me breaking a sweat at the gym, or expanding my mind with a great book - I love deep books like Russell's History of Western Philosophy. 

DREAM JOB / DREAM BAND / DREAM GOALS

My dream is to create a higher awareness of the West African (Mande) musical idiom in this city while recruiting sophisticated and open-minded players to help me fuse it with Rock, Jazz and other genres. I want that to be the spearhead of a larger cultural movement that could spread accross the whole world and help mend cultural differences!
