AboutMeWire CODE

DESCRIBE

I'm Danny Singer - <b>passionate</b> about developing your web presence! I'm always trying to solve two puzzles: 
    
1. Using the latest advances in web technology and code to develop      functional, beautiful and mobile-friendly web sites.  

2. How to help as many people and organizations as possible show their <>best<> selves on the web. 

IMPORTANT 2 ME

Good comminication with my clients is the cornerstone of my philosophy. We will work together to create a blueprint of your needs and desires so that you get <>exactly<> what you need and what can make <>you<> stand out from all the other sites out there.  


WHERE FROM 

I was born and raised in diverse and cosmopolitan Toronto, Ontario. Toronto is known world-wide for being a melting pot of many diverse cultures and creeds, and I have always been profoundly inspired by that.  Being a Torontonian helps me bring an open-mindedness and synthetic attitude to everything I do. 

HOBBIES 

Call me a nerd, but I love coding in my spare time. I also love music and anything with a good beat. Dancing and moving the body are great ways that I love to de-stress. 

DREAM JOB / BAND / DREAM GOALS etc. 

My dream is to start a non-profit web-based platform that is specifically designed to connect people all across the world while helping to spread knowledge of human beings' similarity and potential for co-operation. 

MUSIC LISTENING

West African, Afro-Cuban, Salsa
