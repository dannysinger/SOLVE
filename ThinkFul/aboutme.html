     Hello! I'm a Toronto area drummer and percussionist with 15 years of experience and a <span>passion</span> for a great groove. I especially love West African and African-derived musics (Cuban, Jazz, Blues etc.). I loathe being seen as "just a drummer" because melody and harmony also make my spirit soar! I don't just drum, I <span class="love">sing</span> with the drums!

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>
      Toronto is my city and I <span>thrive</span> off of the diversity of <span>cultures</span>, <span>people</span> and <span>music</span> that can be found here. You could just as easily catch me checking out some killer live salsa at Lula Lounge or playing some jazz with friends from world-renowned Humber College at one of this city's many sophisticated jazz bars.

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are my hobbies?</h2> <!--bold, left text-align, 
    Open sans w/ fallbacks, 20px size, and a 20px bottom margin-->
    <p>
     When not playing, practicing, or checking out music, you might find me breaking a sweat at the gym, or expanding my mind with a great book - I love deep books like Russell's History of Western Philosophy. 
    </p>
    <h2>What is my greatest dream?</h2>
    <p>
      My dream is to create a higher awareness of the West African (Mande) musical idiom in this city while recruiting sophisticated and open-minded players to help me fuse it with Rock, Jazz and other genres. I want that to be the spearhead of a larger cultural movement that could spread accross the whole world and help mend cultural differences!
