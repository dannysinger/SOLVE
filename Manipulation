GUILT

Guilt is a sign or, tugging on the sleeve

"There's something, unresolved"

"Perhaps I was Wrong in this area., Reparations"

"Reliving the bite"

"If you have known or unknown fallen off and hurt and molested,

Suffering the consequences of those consequences of those 

actions and thought patterns. 

Sorry 

heartfelt

attempted to make reparations

you're still trying to hold me hostage. 

Your problem" 

"I'm letting you go."

Beat over the head for the rest of live because of guilt, remorse and shame

I have suffered more than enough for this. It's time to move on." 

GIVE ME SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT. 

BRACE FOR A FEW BLOWOUTS

    - If you had free access to a candy store, you could get whatever you want. 
    - Now you're upset when the candy gets taken. 
    - They are used to getting what they want.
